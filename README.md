**HR Analysis Dashboard (2016 to 2024)**

Welcome to the HR Analysis Dashboard. This project serves as a strategic visualization and analysis tool developed to support workforce planning, identify promotion-ready employees, and extract key human resource insights from 2016 to 2024.
This dashboard was built using Microsoft Excel to present data-driven findings in a clear and accessible format.

**Project Objective**

The objective of this project was to analyze HR data and identify employees eligible for promotion across various departments. By examining employment history, demographics, departmental structures, and salary distribution, this dashboard helps support fair and strategic human capital decisions.

**Key Insights**

**Promotion Eligibility**

Out of a total of 80 employees, 19 were identified as due for promotion, while 61 were not yet due. This helps HR prioritize development opportunities for those ready to move into leadership or specialized roles.

**Demographic Breakdown**

**Age and Gender**

Most employees are within the 28 to 34 age range, with the highest concentration between 31 and 34. Gender distribution is generally balanced, with a slight female majority among older employees.

**Marital Status**

There are 46 single employees, 32 married employees, and 2 who identify as others. These insights can guide HR in shaping benefit programs and policies that consider different lifestyle needs.

**Departmental Distribution**

Employees are evenly distributed across six departments:
•	Marketing: 15 employees
•	IT: 14 employees
•	Operations: 13 employees
•	Sales: 13 employees
•	HR: 13 employees
•	Finance: 12 employees
This balance indicates a well-structured organization and supports department-level planning.

**Salary Segmentation**

Employees fall into four salary bands:
•	Very Low: 21 employees
•	Low: 33 employees (largest group)
•	High: 14 employees
•	Very High: 12 employees
This segmentation highlights the company's wage distribution and supports compensation and equity analysis.

**States of Origin**

The five most common states of origin among employees are:
•	Anambra: 9 employees
•	Imo: 6 employees
•	Kano: 6 employees
•	Abia: 5 employees
•	Ebonyi and Delta: 5 employees each
This reflects geographic diversity and contributes to an inclusive organizational culture.

**Employment History (2016 to 2021)**

The highest number of hires occurred in 2018 with 20 new employees. Hiring declined in subsequent years, with only 2 hires in 2021, likely due to organizational restructuring or external market factors.

**Tech Stack**
